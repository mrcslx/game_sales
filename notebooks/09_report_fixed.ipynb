    "The main insights gained through modelling the data available to us are as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- European and North American sales are good indicators of global sales performance. If a game performs well in either of those markets, it is likely that it would perform well globally.\n",
    "- Critic scores are a good indicator of how well a game will perform globally. The higher the average critic score, the more copies the game is likely to sell. User scores on the other hand are less correlated to global sales.\n",
    "- The following game genres appear more likely to sell higher numbers of copies globally: action, action-adventure, MMO, RPG, sandbox, shooter.\n",
    "- Unfortunately the models did not lend themselves to determining which publishers or platforms were more likely to have high sales numbers. Perhaps more data sources could be used in the future to help with these predictors.\n",

    "Although the process led to some valuable insights, there is room to build more robust models once more varied data is available."
